    <blockquote>
        <p>“Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting
            or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some
            way so
            your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted,
            you're
            there.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you
            touched
            it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just
            cuts
            lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been
            there at
            all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”</p>
